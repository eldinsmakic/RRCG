# RRCG

Renault Radio Code Generator help when you car run out off batterie and you need to enter again your radio code but lost it
RRCG find code by using your precode that is on the back of your radio

The idea is to design the app usign Adobe XD and an uml creator then develop it in TDD style

## Designing the APP

I needed an app that is simple, that can have a page where you enter the precode and get the code

and another page where you can understand how to find the precode of your radio
